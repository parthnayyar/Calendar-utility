# Calendar-utility

In this utility, I have integrated Python with MySQL. Each user will have their own account and can add/delete/update/view events of their calendar. The program also creates a csv file containing each user's calendar years data. 

For each user, a new database is created in MySQL, and for each calendar year the user accesses, a new table gets created. Lastly, there is a unique table which contains the password of the user.
This is obviously very poor design. (I made this project when I had just one year of programming experience)

I have not yet documented this program yet.
